# UCI_First_Assignment
First assignment due for UCI bootcamp

I organized the website to meet all accessibility standards.
Source code is comprised of semantic HTML elements.
The structure of the HTML elements follow a logical structure with style and positioning.
Both the icon and image elements have accessible alternate attributes.
All heading attributes are in sequential order.
The title element contains a concise and descriptive title.
